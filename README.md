MOD LINK: The mod is most likely gonna be out today (Oct 21) or tomorrow. (Oct 22) The reason the links keep getting taken down is because the smuggler where you buy the repair kits and stuff kept on breaking. So i'm just gonna use another mod to create it publicly available again.

Q: What does this mod do?
A: Well let me break it down for you.

1. You can fly with Black Wings (They will appear in your Armor Section if i'm not wrong.)
2. When you die, it will show you claws.
3. Choco bars have MAX calories instead of the original
4. You can fly with all the School Bags. (Purple, Orange, and Green.)
5. You can now modify your username to 30 characters instead of the original 21.
6. You can see that the condition on the school bags are bugged too. Sadly thats just for looks.
